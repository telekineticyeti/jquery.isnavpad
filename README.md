jquery.isNavpad

## Navigation Padder jQuery plugin

This plugin facilitates the creation of a horizontal navigation with equidistant margins between items. It also supports the declaration of 'reserved' space into the calculation - which may be used for inserting logotypes or other elements.

The calculation is reset when the window is resized, making it appropriate for responsive / elastic layouts.

#### Usage:

''' $('nav#mainmenu ul').isNavpad({'reserve': 0});
